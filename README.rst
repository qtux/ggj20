Game Flow
=========

The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of five actions per player.
Each round starts with the **Preparation Phase**, followed by the **Action Phase**.
The initial setup consists of:

- put the main game board -- the deck of your magical ship -- to the center of the table.
- shuffle the mage sheets and deal one to each player
- put one mage tokens in each corner of the board
- put a dice on the mage sheet hit point slot to indicate your current life (starter: 6, advanced: 4, crazy wizard: 2)
- randomly put obstacle tokens (starter: 4, advanced: 6, crazy wizard: 8) on the playfield ensuring that no mage is blocked


**Preparation Phase**:

- add another hazard token to all hazards not dealt with the last round
- use a D8 and D10 to randomly spawn the following hazards at the rolled coordinae:
  + 1 fire
  + 1 hull breach
  + 1 rat plague
  + 2 corruption
- during this phase, you may chat with each other to plan your moves
- shuffle the action cards and deal ten unrevealed to each player and one to a backup pile


**Action Phase**:

- the action phase has a time limit of 1:30
- one of you may discard his hand and replace it with the backup pile
- pick five actions and put them in front of you in a defined order, possible actions are:
  + movement, rotation or repair (turn one of the action cards on the back to indicate a repair action)
  + each mage can repair a single fire, hull breach or rat token without taking damage
  + only the three specialized mages -- as indicated by their respective sheet and matching color -- can repair larger hazards without taking damage
  + every mage which is not specialized in dealing with fire, hull breaches or rat plagues gets one point of damage per token beyond the first one
  + each mage gets one point of damage for each removed corruption token
- you may chat with each other to optimize your turns
- if time runs out, every mage has to pick cards at random until everyone has exactly five chosen actions


You win the game if you surived the yourney, that means:

- no player died (dropping the health below 1)
- no hazard reached the fourth level
- there were not more than two hazard of the same type at the end of a round
- you and your ship survied six rounds
